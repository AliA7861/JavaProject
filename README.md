# Creating a Game Using Java

This is a game that I developed and built entirely in Java for my university programming project.

Aim/Purpose of Game:
- The player must collect all the keys in the current level in order to pass through the portal into the next level.
- Player starts with an initial number of lives, displayed through a life counter to help keep track.
- Each level contains an enemy character that adds a different difficulty level, deducting the lives from the player every time they collide with the enemy in the game. The number of lives that decreases the player's life count increase with each level.
- The player can collect power-ups within the game to help make it easier to complete, with 'heart' power-ups allowing the player to increase their number of lives and 'star' power-ups enabling the player to eliminate a enemy in the level.
- The enemy in the final level will set the player's life count to 0 which terminates the game.
